#WorldClim BioClimatic Data for CTFS-ForestGEO Sites

**Temporal coverage**: 1960 - 1990 

**Temporal resolution**: 30 years (climatic average)

**Geographic coverage**: global

**Spatial resolution**: 30 seconds

**Variables**: 19 bioclimatic variables: http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim

##Data set description
For all ForestGEO sites (current as of Jan. 2017), we extracted 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim v. 1.4, downloaded November 2013 from http://www.worldclim.org/.

##Notes

These data are an updated version of those presented in Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2015), which used the same WorldClim version (1.4) but included fewer CTFS-ForestGEO sites.

Comparison of available local weather station data (Table 2 in Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2014) to WorldClim data revealed close correlation for MAT (R2 >97%). However, WorldClim data tended to systematically underestimate MAP at sites with high MAP, particularly those receiving >3000 mm yr-1 (e.g., Korup, Kuala Belalong, Sinharaja, Fushan, La Planada). Thus, WorldClim precipitation values for high precipitation sites should be considered probable underestimates.
