# Meteorological Station Data for Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI)

SCBI currently has extensive meteorological monitoring, including:

1- **CTFS-ForestGEO meteorological station**, starting 2009. All data are archived [here](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Met_Station_Data/SCBI/ForestGEO_met_station-SCBI).

2- **National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) terrestrial and aquatic monitoring stations**, starting 2015. Monitoring stations include an above-canopy tower just outside the ForestGEO plot, with measurements at a variety of heights above/within/below the canopy (terrestrial site - "SCBI"), and below-canopy stations along a stream within the plot (aquatic site - "POSE"). All data are archived and freely available on [NEON's data portal](http://data.neonscience.org/home). 

Prior to 2009, the closest weather station was the [**Front Royal weather station**](https://github.com/forestgeo/Climate/tree/master/Met_Station_Data/SCBI/Front%20Royal%20weather%20station). These records go back to 1995.

We also have monthly [**PRISM**](http://prism.oregonstate.edu/) data at 800m. resolution for 1930-2015. These data are is available upon request from Kristina Anderson-Teixeira.
