## Data set description:
This is a gap-filled version of data from the Parque Natural Metropolitano canopy crane, whose description and data are available [here](http://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/physical_monitoring/research/metpark). 

Data were gap filled by Victoria Meakem using a method developed by Steve Paton (Director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Insitute's Physical Monitoring program). Missing values were filled by averaging data from two nearby ACP (Panama Canal Authority) stations – Albrook Airbase and Balboa Heights, located 4-5 km away. Rainfall measurements from ACP stations were corrected to match plot stations for both Cocoli and San Lorenzo using linear regression (detailed in metadata). This dataset was used in Meakem et al. (2017), *New Phytologist*.
