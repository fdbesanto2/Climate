##Data set description:
In order to obtain standardized climate data for all sites, global climate data with 0.5 degree spatial resolution were downloaded in February 2017. Specifically, we retrieved monthly data for 1951 – 2014 for ten variables: daily mean temperature (°C), monthly average daily minimum temperature (°C), monthly average daily maximum temperature (°C), diurnal temperature range (°C), frost day frequency (days), precipitation (mm), wet day frequency (days), cloud cover (%), and vapour pressure (hecta-Pascals) from the CRU-TS v3.23 Historic Climate Database for GIS (badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cru/). In addition, potential evapotranspiration (PET; mm day-1) estimates were obtained from the Global Potential Evapo-Transpiration (Global-PET) dataset (Zomer, 2007; Zomer et al., 2008). 

##Notes:
These data are an updated version of those presented in Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2015), which included data through 2012 from the CRU-TS v3.10.01 database.

Comparison of available local weather station data (Table 2 in Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2015) to CRU data revealed close correlation for MAT (R2 >94%). However, CRU data tended to systematically underestimate MAP at sites with high MAP, particularly those receiving >3000 mm yr-1 (e.g., Korup, Kuala Belalong, Sinharaja, Fushan, La Planada). Thus, CRU precipitation values for high precipitation sites should be considered probable underestimates.

##Data use:

Researchers who wish to use this data product are responsible to understand and evaluate its appropriateness for their research purposes. The CRU data product is described in Harris et al. (2014). The Global Potential Evapo-Transpiration (Global-PET) dataset is described in  Zomer (2007) and Zomer et al. (2008).

Publications using these data should cite Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2015), the CRU-TS v3.23 Historic Climate Database (University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit 2008), and, for PET measurements only, the Global Potential Evapo-Transpiration (Global-PET) dataset (Zomer, 2007; Zomer et al., 2008).
