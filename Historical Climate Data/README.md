               Vapour pressure,
               Potential evapotranspiration

##Data set description:
In order to obtain standardized climate data for all sites, global climate data with 0.5 degree spatial resolution were downloaded from the CGIAR-CSI database (http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data) in February 2017. Specifically, we retrieved monthly data for 1951 – 2014 for ten variables: daily mean temperature (°C), monthly average daily minimum temperature (°C), monthly average daily maximum temperature (°C), diurnal temperature range (°C), frost day frequency (days), precipitation (mm), wet day frequency (days), cloud cover (%), and vapour pressure (hecta-Pascals) from the CRU-TS v3.23 Historic Climate Database for GIS (http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/uea-cru-ts-v3-10-01-historic-climate-database). In addition, potential evapotranspiration (PET; mm day-1) estimates were obtained from the Global Potential Evapo-Transpiration (Global-PET) dataset (http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/global-aridity-and-pet-database; Zomer, 2007; Zomer et al., 2008). 

##Notes:
These data are an updated version of those presented in Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2015), which included data through 2012 from the CRU-TS v3.10.01 database.

Comparison of available local weather station data (Table 2 in Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2015) to CRU data revealed close correlation for MAT (R2 >94%). However, CRU data tended to systematically underestimate MAP at sites with high MAP, particularly those receiving >3000 mm yr-1 (e.g., Korup, Kuala Belalong, Sinharaja, Fushan, La Planada). Thus, CRU precipitation values for high precipitation sites should be considered probable underestimates.
