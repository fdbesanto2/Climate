## About this repository
This repository is designed to serve as a portal for climate data and information for CTFS-ForestGEO sites. The CTFS-ForestGEO Ecosystems & Climate Initiative aims to:

1. Provide information on the climate data sources that are available for CTFS-ForestGEO sites.

2. Archive and distribute climate data for CTFS-ForestGEO sites that are (i) collected at our sites and not archived elsewhere, (ii) cleaned/ gap-filled and not archived elsewhere, and (iii) extracted from gridded databases for our sites.
